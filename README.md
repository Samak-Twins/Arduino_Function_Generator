# Arduino Function Generator

  This repository hosts the programs for generating fundamental waveforms (signals) using Arduino microcontroller.
  
  Following are the supported waveform types:
  - DC
  - Pulse
  - Sawtooth
  - Sine
  - Square
  - Triangle
  
  <b>Note:</b> MCP4725 I2C DAC Breakout Development Board Module was used to generate the continuous time (analog) signals.
